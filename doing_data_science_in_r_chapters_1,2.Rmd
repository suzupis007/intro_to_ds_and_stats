## Chapter 1 HW
Consider Figure 1.1 (page 2) with respect to some particular scientific research study, such as a research project that the reader might be undertaking. What is involved in the data analysis of the study at all its stages, from processing raw data to eventual communication of results? How much time is likely to be needed at each stage? What specifically needs to be done at each stage? Will R be sufficient for all the stages of analysis of the study? What other tools are required?

  *Social and Economical Differences 
  Neighborhoods Walkability Across 500 U.S.
  Cities*. American Journal of Preventive
  Medicine, 61(3) 394-401
  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721002270
  
First stage, Raw data: 
Walkability was measured by 2019 Walk Score, acquired by data use agreement between Walk Score and City Health Dashboard, a free online public health resource. The walkability score was given a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100. The area scored was broken down into 500 square foot blocks sections within cities excluding areas where people did not live.
Sociodemographic factors in analysis, income and majority race/ethnicity, were measured from a 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimate at a city and census tract level. Income was broken down into low, middle, and high tertiles and race/ethnicity was defined by >50% of total population from predetermined area.

Second Stage, Tidy data:
This paper determined what factors would be used in the analysis, how to define each factor, what each factor consisted of (be it income, race, or area) to divide into groups. 

Third Stage, Visualization & Exploration:
	A table (Table 1) was created to show how each factor corresponded to the walk score at a univariable level. In order to account for each multiple factors differing across neighborhoods within a city, a multivariable a multi-level linear regression model was created to further understand how the factors combined corresponded to a walk score.

Fourth Stage, Model & Fitted Model:
	A model was created for the data showing an inverse relationship between income level and walk score, where low-income areas had higher walk scores. This holds true for all races identified as a group except cities where a majority of the population was black, where higher income levels corresponded to higher walk scores. A correlation was also found when analyzing the area of the city being analyzed. Cities in the northeast had weakest association between walkability and sociodemographic factors where southern and western cities had the highest correspondence. 

Fifth Stage, Communication:
	An essay was written presenting the data.

Time Considerations:
	No mention of time spent at each stage was mentioned. Based on what was written, it seems as though a lot of time was spent tidying the data as well as creating the models.
R and other tools:
	No mention of R was found in essay, but as I understand, it should be an acceptable tool for analyzing the data. Chapter 1 highly touts the ability of R to analyze the data, as well as being uniquely suited to have the ability to create tools in order to analyze data. Other tools were used, like Walk Score and City Health Dashboard, in this study which could be incorporated into the R program for analysis.

## Chapter 2 HW  

Step 0: Using the R console
The console is a good place to begin typing commands when first learning but best use is for help on commands (?include_graphics or help(include_graphicshelp()))

Step 1: Using R as a calculator
```{r math functions}
# addition
2 + 2
100 + 200

# subtraction
2 - 2
200 - 100
5 - 8
2.2 - 1.1

# multiplication
2 * 2
51.9 * 5

# division
4 / 8
8 / 4

# exponents
2 ^ 2
2 ** 2

# combining operators
(2 * 2) + 4
20 * 110 - 5 / 3 ^ 2
```
  
Step 2: Variables and assignments
```{r Variables and assignments}
# store values in r by assigning to a variable
x <- (40 / 2) ** 2 - (4 + (3-1))

# variables can be used like any other number
x / 2

# result can also be assigned to a variable
y <- x / 2

# Assignment rule:
# name <- expression
# acceptable:
# x1
# x.1
# x-1
# (best practice is snake case):
# x_1

# unnacceptable:
# _x
# 1_x
# .1x
# x-1
```

Step 3: Vectors, numeric
```{r numeric vectors}
# vectors are 1 dimensional sequences of values
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29)

# operations can be performed on vectors
primes + 1
primes * 2

# index vectors, 1 based system, call index to get value
primes[5]             # single element
primes[c(1, 3, 5)]    # index a set of elements
primes[5:7]           # index a consecutive set of elements
primes[-5:-7]         # exclude a set of elements

# single values are also elements that can be indexed
z <- 42
z[1]

# class of vectors
class(primes)         # class of primes is numeric




# boolean or logical operations

```

Step 3: Vectors, character
```{r character vectors}
# character vectors
nation <- c('us', 'uk', 'china', 'chile', 'ireland', 'france', 'italy')
class(nation)         # class of nation is character

# character vectors can are indexed like numeric vectors
nation[5]
nation[c(1, 5, 6, 7)]
nation[c(-1, -5, -6, -7)]
nation[3:6]

# math opertations cannot be performed on character vectors
# 'nation - 2' returns: Error in nation - 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator

```

Step 3: Vectors, logical
```{r logical vectors}
# logical vectors
is_animal <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
is_animal_2 <- c(T, F, T, F)
class(is_animal)      # returns logical class
is_animal[c(1, 4)]    # logical vectors are indexed

# math works on logical vectors, TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0
result <- is_animal * 2
result
class(result)
```

Step 3: Vectors, boolean or logical operations
```{r boolean operations}
# & is and, test if 2 logical values are true
T & T
T & F
c(F, T, F) & c(T, T, T)

# | is or, tests if one or the other is true
T | F
FALSE | FALSE

# ! negates the logical value (think 'not')
T & !T

# boolean operations can be combined
 (TRUE | !TRUE) & !FALSE
```

Step 3: Vectors, Equality/Inequality operations
```{r equality and inequality operations}
# equal to '==', not equal to '!='
primes != 7           # check across vector for values not 7
look_for_7 <- primes == 7
look_for_7            # a vector looking for 7
class(look_for_7)     # logical values

# less than '<' or greater than '>'
primes < 9
primes > 9

# less than or equal to '<=' and greater than or equal to '>='
primes <= 7
primes >= 7

# equality operations work on character class vector
nation == 'italy'
```

Step 3: Vectors, coercing vectors
```{r coercing vectors}
# vectors are homogenous (all elements are same class)
combo_1 <- c(T, F, 3, 2, -1, T)
combo_2 <- c(3, 2, T, F, 'dog', 'cat')

combo_1
combo_2

class(combo_1)
class(combo_2)
```

Step 3: Vectors, combining vectors
```{r combining vectors}
# vectors can be combined using combine function
primes_combo <- c(primes, primes + 1, primes^2)
```

Step 3: Vectors, named vectors
```{r named vectors}
# elements of a vector can be named
neighbors <- c(flip = 107, andrew = 120, piere = 127)

# access a named vector by index and names
neighbors[2]
neighbors['andrew']

# existing vectors can be named
cousins <- c(20, 25, 27)
names(cousins) <- c('tyler', 'kari', 'mike')

cousins[3]
```

Step 3: Vectors, missing values
```{r missing values}
# missing values in a vector are denoted as 'NA'
incomplete_values <- c(4, 6, 2, NA, 8, 2)
incomplete_values[c(2, 4)]

# 'NA' (in quotes) is not the same as NA
character_values <- c(4, 6, 2, 'NA', 8, 2)

class(incomplete_values)
class(character_values)
```

Step 4: Data frames
```{r data frames}
# data frames are like tables in excel
cousin_df <- data.frame(name = c('tyler', 'kari', 'kari'), age = c(20, 25, 27))
cousin_df

# indexing data frames name[row #, column #]
cousin_df[3, 2]
# indexing multiple rows
cousin_df[c(1, 3), 2]
# indexing complete row
cousin_df[1, ]
# indexing complete column
cousin_df[, 1]
# can also use $ to access a column name
cousin_df$age
```

Step 5: Other data structures, lists
```{r lists}
# allow for storage of multiple heterogenous data structures
example_list <- list(A = c(T, F, T, F), B = c('ireand'), C = c(4, 7, 1))
example_list

# indexing lists, use double brackets or $ symbol
example_list[['C']]
example_list$C
example_list['C']

example_list[['C']] == example_list$C
# 'example_list$C == example_list['C']' returns Error: 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'

class(example_list$C)
class(example_list['C'])
```

Step 5: Other data structures, matrices
```{r matrices}
# equivalent to 2d vector with n x m format where each column has n rows and each row has m columns

# arranged by column first then row
m_1 <- matrix(c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), nrow=2, ncol=5)
m_1

# arranged by row first then column
m_2 <- matrix(c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), byrow = T, nrow=2, ncol=5)
m_2

# create matrix binding to row
m_3 <- rbind(c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11), c(13, 17, 19, 23, 29))
m_3

# create by binding to columns
m_4 <- cbind(c(2, 3), c(5, 7), c(11, 13), c(17, 19), c(23, 39))
m_4

# index a matrix similar to how data frames are indexed
m_1[2, 4]
m_1[2, ]
m_1[, 4]
```

Step 5: Other data structures, arrrays
```{r}
# arrays are n dimentional generalizations of matrices
example_array <- array(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), dim=c(2,2,2))
example_array

# arrays are indexed like a matrix with multiple indexes
example_array[1,,]          # returns 1st row in each dimension
example_array[,1,]          # returns 1st column in each dimension
example_array[,,1]          # returns 1st dimension
example_array[1,,1]         # returns 1st row from every column in 1st dimension

```

Step 6: Functions
```{r functions}
# functions do things to or with the data

# length function returns the count of the number of elements in vector/list/matrix, etc.
length(primes)              # returns count of elements in vector
length(example_list)        # returns count of data structures in the list
length(example_list[1])     # returns count of data structures entered
length(example_list[[1]])   # returns count of elements in list data structure
length(example_array)       # returns count of elements in array

# functions can be nested
round(sqrt(mean(primes)))

# some functions have optional arguments, look into with help
mean(primes, trim = 0.1)    # removes 10% of highest and lowest values
```

Step 7: scripts
```{r scripts}
# scripts is what I am using to write this for homework. commands that are written here will be executed in console when prompted

# commands are run by clicking in line and pressing 'run' button or ctrl + enter

# multiline commands are executed in same manner as single code lines

# comments are entered by placing a # in from of text that isn't desired to be part of code
```

Step 8: Installing and loading packages
```{r packages}
# packages that are installed into R will be in packages pane

# to install packages, type " install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"))"

# to load packages for using, type "library("dplyr")

# when loading a package, a prompt will show what functions are being turned off or on and from what package
```

Step 9: Reading in and viewing data  
```{r reading and viewing data}
library(readr)                         # package loaded to read file
weight <- read_csv("Data/weight.csv")  # read in file
View(weight)                           # view file
```

Step 10: Working directory, RStudio projects, and clean workspaces
```{r working directory}
# the working directory is where the R file will be running from. need to know this when loading files. in projects (markdown), the directory is the folder it is saved in, else as denoted by going to 'Tools', 'Global Options...', 'General', 'Default working directory'

getwd()

# for importing data from csv when sharing, make sure data is stored in subdirectory to make it easier to import

# use brooms to clean workspace (work enviroment, console)
